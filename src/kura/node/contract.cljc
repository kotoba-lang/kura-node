  "The conformance suite every shard backend must pass.

  Shipped in `src`, not `test`, for the same reason
  `kotobase.storage.contract` is: a third party writing a backend needs to run
  it, and a suite that lives in this repo's test path is a suite they cannot
  reach. `check` is `(fn [truthy label])` so the caller supplies its own
  assertion — `clojure.test/is`, a CI reporter, or a node operator's
  self-check at startup.

  What the suite does NOT do is verify the `:independence` declaration. It
  cannot: whether two buckets share a control plane is a fact about the world,
  not about the API. `kura.node.store/audit` reports the consequences of the
  declaration, and the declaration itself is a claim its operator is
  accountable for."
