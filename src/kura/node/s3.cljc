  "An S3-compatible shard store — Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or
  Storj's Gateway-MT.

  These are the pseudo-nodes Phase 0 runs on (ADR-2607299200 section 8): you
  cannot pick a storage multiplier without a measured node-loss rate, and you
  cannot measure one without running the coding, placement, audit and order
  planes against something real. Rented backends are that something.

  **Read the `:independence` declaration before believing a durability
  number.** `open` requires it and offers no default. Twenty-six of these on
  one account are one failure domain, and `kura.node.store/audit` will say so.
  That is not a flaw in Phase 0 — it is the fact Phase 0 exists to make
  visible.

  **Zero I/O and zero crypto here.** `IHttp` puts a fully signed request on the
  wire; `ICrypto` supplies SHA-256 and HMAC. Both are injected, so this
  namespace stays portable `.cljc` and testable without a network — which is
  what lets the request-shaping be checked against known-good vectors rather
  than against whatever a live bucket happens to accept today. The seam is
  lifted from `storj.protocols`, and the signing from `kotoba-lang/sigv4`."
