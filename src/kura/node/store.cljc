  "What a storage node must be able to do, and what it must admit about
  itself.

  The protocol half is unremarkable — put, get, delete, list, size. The half
  that matters is `:failure-domain` and `:independence`, and it is mandatory
  for the same reason `kotobase.storage`'s ref profile is mandatory: **the
  failure mode of guessing is silent.**

  ADR-2607299200 section 1 gets a 1.625x storage multiplier to ten nines by
  assuming shard losses are independent. Phase 0 stands up pseudo-nodes on
  rented backends — B2, R2, S3, Storj — because that is how you measure a
  real node-loss rate before opening to third parties. But **twenty-six
  pseudo-nodes on one B2 account are one node.** The code cannot tell; it sees
  twenty-six shards in twenty-six places and reports seven-erasure tolerance
  that does not exist. What you actually have is B2's durability, and you have
  paid a 1.625x multiplier for the privilege of not getting the code's.

  So a backend declares the domain it shares and how independent it claims to
  be, `independence-profiles` is a closed set, and `kura.node.store/audit`
  reports when a placement's backends collapse into fewer domains than the
  code needs. Declaring is cheap; discovering is a durability event."

  - `:independent` — its own hardware, power and operator. Losing another
    node in the placement says nothing about losing this one. This is what
    the durability model in ADR-2607299200 section 1 assumes of every shard.

  - `:shared-provider` — a distinct bucket, region or account inside one
    provider. Correlated by that provider's control plane, billing and
    outages. Usable, but a placement must not count two of these as two
    domains.

  - `:shared-substrate` — same bucket or same disk, distinguished only by
    key prefix. **Exactly one failure domain no matter how many shards land
    on it.** This is what a Phase 0 pseudo-node fleet on one account really
    is, and naming it is the entire reason this field exists.

  The set is closed and the choice mandatory because a backend that declines
  to answer would default to the flattering option, and the flattering option
  is the one that silently voids the durability argument."

  `:independent` used to key on the NODE ID, which was wrong in a way that
  flattered every fleet: eleven shard slots on one machine then counted as
  eleven failure domains, and an audit that counts domains by node id can be
  satisfied by renaming. Found by this repo's own local-node demo producing
