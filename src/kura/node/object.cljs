  "Store an object and get it back — the operation, not the arithmetic.

  `kura.manifest` has always had the geometry: how many stripes, how many
  shards, what a shard is called, what the amplification comes to. What did
  **not** exist anywhere was a function that takes bytes and puts them on a
  fleet, or takes an object id and returns the bytes. That logic existed twice,
  both times inside a demonstration script — `kura.conformance.durability` and
  `kura-node/script/multi_domain_durability.cljs` — which is why the network
  could prove durability and could not serve anybody. A capability that only
  exists inside its own demo is a capability nobody else can call.

  **The read verifies.** Erasure decoding with a wrong shard produces wrong
  bytes and no error: the algebra is perfectly happy to solve the system it was
  handed. So `get-object>` takes the digest `put-object!>` returned and refuses
  to hand back anything that does not match it. A storage layer that cannot
  tell you whether it returned what you stored is not finished, and the place
  to catch that is here rather than in whatever the caller does next.

  **Placement is somebody else's decision.** `store-for` maps a shard to the
  store that holds it, so this namespace never chooses — `kura.placement`
  chooses, under caps, and the choice is auditable there. Passing stores in
  also means a test can hand it four in-memory stores and mean it."

  **Verification comes before the write, and that ordering is the whole

  mismatch refuses to repair. Writing back shards derived from an unverified
  reconstruction would take a problem that is currently *detectable* — one read
  fails a digest check — and spread it across the fleet as data that decodes
  cleanly to the wrong answer. There is no recovery from that, because every
  copy agrees.

  Writes back everything that was not in hand, absent or unreachable alike. A
  put is idempotent, and the alternative is deciding a shard is fine because the
  fetch that would have proved it failed. The report separates the two counts so
  an operator can see how much of the work was caused by real loss and how much
  by a flaky network — different problems, and only one of them is fixed by
  buying disks."
