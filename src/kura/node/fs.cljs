  "A shard store on a local filesystem.

  The point is not convenience. `/audit` currently reports the Phase 0 fleet as
  **two** failure domains against a code that needs three, and the two are
  rented: Cloudflare and Backblaze. A box somebody actually owns is a third
  domain in the sense that matters — different company, different hardware,
  different power, different control plane — and it is the only one that can be
  added without opening an account with anyone.

  It is also what `run a node` has to mean. An operator network whose only
  backend implementations are other people's clouds is not a storage network,
  it is a reseller with extra steps.

  **`:independent`, and that is a claim the operator makes.** Unlike the rented
  backends, a self-hosted node genuinely is its own domain — but only if it is
  genuinely somebody else's machine. Twenty of these in one rack are one
  domain, and `kura.node.store/audit` will only know that if the operator says
  so in `:failure-domain`. The suite cannot check it; nothing can.

  **Durability here is the operator's, not ours.** A single disk with no
  redundancy is a node that will eventually lose a shard, which is precisely
  what the erasure code exists to absorb — but the operator should know that is
  the arrangement rather than assume the network is protecting their disk."
