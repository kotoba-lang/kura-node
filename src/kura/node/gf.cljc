  "The fast multiply-accumulate — the one seam ADR-2607299200 section 5 names
  as *mechanism* rather than decision.

  `erasure.gf/scale-add` is the definition: a vector of integers, one
  `gf/mul` per byte through a pair of log/exp lookups. It is the oracle, and
  it is far too slow to move a petabyte. This namespace is what a node
  actually runs, and the only thing that makes it legitimate is
  `kura.node.gf-test/byte-equality-with-the-reference`, which asserts the two
  agree **byte for byte** rather than approximately or on a sample of
  convenient inputs.

  **The trick is one table per coefficient.** Multiplication in GF(2^8) by a
  fixed `c` is a permutation of the 256 byte values, so `mul-table(c)` is 256
  bytes and the inner loop degenerates to

      acc[i] ^= table[xs[i]]

  — an indexed load and an xor, no logarithms, no branches. Encoding a stripe
  reuses one table across the whole shard, so the table cost is amortised over
  megabytes. The tables are built from `erasure.gf/mul-def`, the table-free
  definition, so a bug in the fast path cannot be a bug shared with its own
  oracle.

  **Buffers, not vectors.** `Uint8Array` on ClojureScript, `byte[]` on the
  JVM. Java bytes are signed, which is a real hazard here — an index of -1 is
  not an index of 255 — so every read masks with `0xff` and every comparison
  happens in the unsigned domain. `->bytes` and `->vec` convert at the edges
  so the oracle can be compared against without either side knowing about the
  other's representation."
