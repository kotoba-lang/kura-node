(ns kura.node.s3-async
  "The S3-compatible shard store, on the async contract.

  `kura.node.s3` shapes and signs requests — that part is pure `.cljc` and
  correct. What was wrong was its *store*: it implemented the synchronous
  `IShardStore` and therefore only worked with a synchronous transport, which
  no real host has. That store is left in place for a genuinely blocking
  transport and for the request-shaping tests; **this is the one to use.**

  It matters more than it sounds. R2 through a Worker binding needs no HTTP at
  all, so `kura.node.r2` covers a single-provider fleet. But a single provider
  is a single failure domain, and the whole durability argument
  (ADR-2607299200 section 1) needs shards spread across providers that fail
  independently. Reaching another provider means HTTP, HTTP means async, and
  async means this namespace. **Without it there is no multi-provider fleet,
  and without a multi-provider fleet the storage multiplier buys nothing.**

  Transport and crypto stay injected, as in `kura.node.s3` — this adds the
  promise chaining and the response handling, nothing else."
