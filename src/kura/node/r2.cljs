(ns kura.node.r2
  "A shard store on a Cloudflare R2 **binding**.

  Not the S3 API. A Worker talking to its own bucket over SigV4 would be
  signing requests to itself and paying an HTTP round trip for it; the binding
  is a direct call. `kura.node.s3` remains the right adapter for a bucket at
  another provider, or for R2 reached from outside a Worker.

  Async natively, so it implements `kura.node.async/IAsyncShardStore` — which
  is the protocol that exists because the synchronous one silently reported
  every read as absent when handed a promise.

  **Independence.** R2 is one provider and, for a fleet keyed only by object
  prefix, one bucket. `open` still requires the declaration and the honest
  answer here is `:shared-substrate` unless the operator is genuinely running
  separate accounts — `kura.node.store/audit` will then report the fleet as
  the single failure domain it is."
