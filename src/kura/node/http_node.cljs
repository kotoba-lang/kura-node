(ns kura.node.http-node
  "An `IAsyncShardStore` that talks to a remote kura node over HTTP.

  **This was the missing half of the node protocol.** `script/run_node.cljs`
  has served the shard-store contract over HTTP since self-hosted nodes became
  possible, and nothing could consume it: `fs`, `r2` and `s3-async` were the
  only backends, so a coordinator could read a node's `/descriptor` and run its
  `/self-check` but could not place a single shard on it. Self-hosted nodes were
  countable and unusable.

  **What this tests that `/self-check` cannot.** A node's self-check runs the
  contract against its own disk, in-process, bypassing HTTP entirely — so a node
  can report 19/19 while its HTTP surface mis-encodes a range, loses a byte in a
  round trip, or returns 200 for an absent shard. Running the SAME suite through
  this store exercises the wire, and the wire is what a coordinator depends on.
  A backend is not verified by the machine that hosts it.

  `IHttp` is injected, exactly as in `kura.node.s3`: request shaping stays a
  pure function of its inputs, and a test does not need a node running."
