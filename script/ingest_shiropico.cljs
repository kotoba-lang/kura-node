  "The first real workload: SHIRO & PICO production assets onto the live fleet.

  Why this data and not a synthetic object. Everything kura has proved so far
  was proved with bytes generated for the purpose, and a probe that writes its
  own input tells you the code works, not that the system does. Repair events,
  audit outcomes, egress patterns and cost only appear once something is stored
  that somebody would be upset to lose.

  Why it is safe to be the first. These assets already have TWO copies — the
  source bucket `ai-gftd-datasets` and a git-annex trusted copy in
  `gftdcojp-m365-annex`. **Both are Backblaze B2.** Different buckets, one
  provider, therefore one failure domain by `kura.node.store/domain-key`'s own
  reading. So kura failing costs nothing here, and kura succeeding genuinely
  improves this data's durability rather than merely demonstrating something:
  four domains across two providers and two of the owner's own sites, replacing
  redundancy that is currently provider-correlated.

  Excludes `episode/` — 82 objects, 10 GB of the 10.4 GB total. This run is the
  other 206, about 294 MB: scene stills, bgm, panels, op cuts, motion comic. A
  coherent set that finishes, rather than a number that looks bigger."

  "shard index -> store, chosen by kura.placement under a per-domain cap.

  Placement decides, not this script. That is the difference between a
  demonstration and a system: the same function that will place a customer's
  shards places these.

  **Backends are expanded into slots first.** `select` picks n DISTINCT nodes,
  and there are 5 backends for 32 shards — so a backend has to hold several,
  and each slot carries its backend's domain so the cap counts the domain rather
  than the box. Skipping this is how the first attempt asked for 32 nodes, got
  5, and correctly refused to place.

  The cap is the even spread, ceil(n / domains) = 8, not the code's tolerance of
  13. Both are survivable; 8 leaves 5 shards of margin after losing a domain and
  13 leaves none, and there is no reason to spend margin that costs nothing to
