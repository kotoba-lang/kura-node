  "Run the shard-store contract against a remote node THROUGH its HTTP surface.

      nbb --classpath \"src:script:...\" script/remote_node_check.cljs \\
        http://100.82.98.110:8410

  A node's own `/self-check` runs the contract against its disk, in-process,
  bypassing HTTP. So it can report 19/19 while the wire mis-encodes a range,
  drops a byte, or answers 200 for an absent shard — and the wire is the only
  part a coordinator ever touches. This is the client's view, which is the one
  that matters."
