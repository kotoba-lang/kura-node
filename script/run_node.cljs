  "A runnable kura storage node.

  `kura.node.fs` made a self-hosted node *possible*; this makes it a command.
  The distance between those two is the whole reason the fleet is still short a
  failure domain — a backend nobody can start is not a node.

  **What it serves.** The async shard-store contract over HTTP, plus the
  descriptor and a self-check. A coordinator probes it exactly the way
  `kura.conformance` probes a rented bucket, so a self-hosted node is not a
  special case anywhere in the system.

  **What it does NOT do, and must not be mistaken for.**

  - *No authentication.* Phase 0 places no customer data and takes no bond, so
    there is nothing here to steal. The moment either changes, every mutating
    request must carry a signed order (`kura.order/admit` already decides this)
    and this script must refuse to start without a verifier. That refusal is
    written as an assertion below rather than left as a TODO, because a node
    that quietly serves unauthenticated writes with real data on it is the
    failure this whole project keeps trying not to ship.
  - *No public address.* Binding a port is not being reachable. A node behind
    NAT needs a tunnel or a forwarded port; the coordinator cannot probe what
    it cannot reach. Whether that unreachability reads as a fault depends on
    `--availability`: an `intermittent` node is *expected* to go quiet, and the
    fleet caps how much of an object may depend on it precisely so that it can.
  - *No redundancy of its own.* One disk, no RAID. That is fine — absorbing a
    lost shard is what the erasure code is for — but the operator should know
    that is the arrangement rather than assume the network protects their disk."
