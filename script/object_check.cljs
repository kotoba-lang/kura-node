  "The object layer against real filesystem stores, including the cases where a
  storage system fails silently.

  Not a unit test because `kura.node.object` composes async stores and the
  interesting failures are in the composition: padding on the last stripe, a
  stripe that needs repair, and a digest that does not match. The first two are
  arithmetic anyone would test; the third is the one that matters, because a
  wrong answer that decodes cleanly is the failure mode with no recovery."
