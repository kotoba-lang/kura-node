  "Read every stored object back and check it against the digest the ingest
  recorded.

  Storing is not the claim. The claim is that it comes back, and the only way to
  make that checkable later is the receipt: `put-object!>` returned a digest and
  the ingest wrote it down, so this can be run at any time — after a node
  reboots, after a repair, a month from now — without the original bytes being
  anywhere nearby. That is the difference between a receipt and a log message.

  Verification goes through the same placement the ingest used, and repairs on
  read if shards are missing. A run that reports `repaired > 0` is not a failure;
  it is the code doing what it exists for, and worth reporting separately from a
  digest mismatch, which is."
